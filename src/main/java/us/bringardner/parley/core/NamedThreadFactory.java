/**
 * <PRE>
 * A ThreadFactory for executors that names its threads and makes them daemon threads (by default),
 * so an executor's threads show up by name in thread dumps and don't keep the JVM running.
 *
 * new NamedThreadFactory("ZoneNotifier")        threads "ZoneNotifier", "ZoneNotifier-2", ...
 * NamedThreadFactory.numbered("TCPConn")        threads "TCPConn1", "TCPConn2", ...
 * new NamedThreadFactory("Worker").daemon(false)  non-daemon threads
 * new NamedThreadFactory("Worker").virtual(true)  virtual threads on Java 21+ (platform threads before)
 *
 * Instances are immutable and thread safe; daemon() and virtual() return a new factory.
