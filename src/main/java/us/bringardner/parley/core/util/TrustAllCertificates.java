/**
 * <PRE>
 * A trust manager that accepts EVERY certificate: expired, self signed, issued for another host
 * or by nobody anyone trusts. A connection that uses it is encrypted but not authenticated, so
 * anyone able to intercept it can read and change it.
 *
 * Only for cases where that is the intent: opportunistic TLS (SMTP STARTTLS between mail servers,
 * which falls back to plain text anyway), or a test against a server with a throw away certificate.
 * It has one well known name so these uses are easy to find; don't write another.
